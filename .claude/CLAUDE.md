For web projects:
- Always use bun rather than npm
- I prefer using Typescript whenever possible
- For browser automation testing, use `uvx webctl`. Run `uvx webctl agent-prompt` for usage.

For python projects:
- Always use uv when possible
- Always use type hints
- I use ruff and ty for checking & formatting.

For C/C++ projects:
- Use pcons for building in new code
- I write C++17 or later code, sometimes C++20, but always respect what the project I'm in uses.
