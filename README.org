By default, ~espanso~ wants its config files in different dirs per OS.
But as of Oct 2022, it supports ~/.config/espanso on all OSes, so
this info is only for historical value. Read on if you want:

To support that, I used to use chezmoi's templates.
See https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/#more-complicated-logic
The actual config file goes in ~.chezmoitemplates~,
then each of the possible config locations has a directory tree
here (e.g. ~Library/Preferences/espanso~) with a file that references
the template using this special syntax:
```
{{- template "espanso-symbols.yml" . -}}
```

To prevent all the dirs from being created on all OSes, see
~.chezmoiignore~ which allows ignoring files per-OS like this:
```
{{ if ne .chezmoi.os "darwin" }}
Library/Preferences/espanso
{{ end }}
```

Note that since this is an "ignore" file the syntax looks a bit
backwards.  It's a bit complicated but it works.
